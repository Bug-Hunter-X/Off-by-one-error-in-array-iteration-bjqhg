This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating a common off-by-one error when iterating over an array. The `Bug.java` file shows the erroneous code, while `BugSolution.java` provides the corrected version. The error arises from an incorrect loop condition, which causes an attempt to access an element beyond the array's bounds, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to iterate and avoid this common pitfall.
